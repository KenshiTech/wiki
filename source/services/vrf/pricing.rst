Pricing
=======

We make an estimation of how much gas is required to deliver randomness to your
smart contract, add 10% to it, convert it to Kenshi and then transfer the converted
amount from your smart contract to our reserve address.

For example, if the cost of delivering randomness to your smart contract is about $0.5,
then you will be charged about $0.55 for each randomness.

.. note::

  Make sure you have enough Kenshi tokens stored in your smart contract
  for paying the VRF fees. To test the VRF, you can get testnet Kenshi from our `faucet`_.

Testnets
--------

On testnets the prices are 10 trillion times cheaper than the mainnet. That makes 1 testnet
Kenshi token equal in worth to the mainnet total supply. You can get 2 testnet Kenshi tokens
from our `faucet`_, this amount should be more than enough for testing Kenshi on any of the
testnets.
