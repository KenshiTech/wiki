Pricing
=======

We make an estimation of how much gas is required to deliver randomness to your
smart contract, add 15% to it, convert it to Kenshi and then charge that amount
from your VRF subscription.

VRF subscriptions can be made on the Kenshi dashboard_. All payments for the VRF
fees are processed off-chain and therefore are gas-free. This makes the Kenshi VRF
cheaper compared to the rest.

.. note::

  Make sure you have enough Kenshi tokens in your VRF subscription for paying the
  VRF fees.

Testnets
--------

The VRF service is free of charge on testnets.
