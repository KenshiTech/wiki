Event Listeners
===============

Kenshi event listener task definitions are used by the Kenshi Dispatcher
to listen to events and send them to an HTTP endpoint or an AWS Lambda function.

.. note::

   The AWS Lambda invocation service is implemented and will be available
   for public use as soon as the documentation is ready.
