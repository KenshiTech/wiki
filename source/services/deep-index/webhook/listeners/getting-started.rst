Currently the only way to use the Kenshi Deep Index Dispatcher service is through
the Kenshi beta test program. Reach out to us on our `Telegram chat`_ to get
access.

To use this service you need to submit your task definition, to do so you can
give us a ``.json`` file, or share a GitHub gist with us.
