Getting Started
===============

To integrate the Kenshi Reverse-API service into your ecosystem or workflow,
you need to expose an HTTP POST endpoint that is publicly available over the
internet.

Once ready, you need to define an event listener task, so the Kenshi dispatcher
can find relevant events for you and notify your endpoint whenever it finds them.
To learn more about event listener task definitions continue to the next chapter.
