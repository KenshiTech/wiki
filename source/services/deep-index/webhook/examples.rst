    import express from "express";
    import parser from "body-parser";

    /**

    const app = express();
    app.use(parser.json());

    /**
    * Create a POST endpoint for receiving data from
    * the Kenshi Event Dispatcher

      console.log(req.body);
      /**
      * Your endpoint must return a status code bigger

      */
      res.status(200).end("OK");

        # Details for the received blockchain event are
        # in the request body
        print(request.json)
        # Your endpoint must return a status code bigger
        # than or equal to 200, and lower than 300. Any
