Deep Index
==========

.. admonition:: Currently in beta test

   This service is currently in beta test and active only on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC),
   Fantom (FTM), Polygon (MATIC) and Avalanche (AVAX) testnets. If you wish to participate in
   the beta test send us a message on our `Telegram chat`_.

The Kenshi Deep Index service consists of multiple services for retrieving, querying
and processing blockchain data:

- **Sync** can be used to retrieve, store and index data on the Kenshi database clusters.
- **GraphQL** can be used to query, search and retrieve synced blockchain data in your apps.
- **Reverse-API** can be used to get notifications about new blockchain events on your HTTP endpoints.
