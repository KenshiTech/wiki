Getting Started
===============

To work with the GraphQL endpoint, you need to use a GraphQL library,
or directly make an HTTP POST request to the Kenshi Deep Index endpoint
for GraphQL. The endpoint address and examples for making GraphQL requests
can be found on the next chapters.

The schema for returned data types, as well as the schema for making requests
to the GraphQL endpoint are also provided. The provided schema can be used in
languages such as Go where an interface is required for unpacking the received
GraphQL data.
