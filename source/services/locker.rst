Locker
======

The Kenshi locker can be used to lock any BEP-20 tokens for a set period of time.
For example, you can use it to lock your liquidity tokens or use it to lock up
your team allocations for as long as your project requires.

.. warning::

  When sending tokens to the contract address, make sure you're on the correct
  network. Otherwise your tokens will be lost forever.
