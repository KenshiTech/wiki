Locker
======

The Kenshi locker can be used to lock any BEP-20 tokens for a set period of time.
For example, you can use it to lock your liquidity tokens or use it to lock up
your team allocations for as long as your project requires.

Features
--------

Kenshi lockers have a set of features that makes them stand out in the competition:

- **One-time flat fee**: pay one time and use forever, do whatever.
- **Upgradable**: upgrade your locker to a new version for free any time we add new features.
- **Lock any token**: lock any token on the BNB Chain.
- **Lock multiple tokens**: lock multiple tokens or lp tokens in the same locker.
- **Transfer ownership**: transfer ownership to a new wallet if needed.

Pricing
-------

Kenshi lockers have a one-time flat fee and all future interactions with them
are free. You can either pay or lock a specific amount of Kenshi tokens
for at least a year and get the locker for free. Please note that you won't pay
any Kenshi transaction tax if you choose to pay by locking Kenshi, and you will
receive reflections on top of that.

How to create a locker?
-----------------------

To create a locker, go to the `/lockers`_ page on our website, connect your wallet
and click on the create button. Once the locker creation is done you will be
redirected to the admin page. Be sure to copy the contract address of your newly
created locker so you can manage it later.

How to add tokens to the locker?
--------------------------------

You can either use the admin page of the locker for sending tokens into the locker,
or you can simply send tokens to the locker contract address from the wallet of
your choice.

.. danger::

  When sending tokens to the contract address, make sure you're on the correct
  network. Otherwise, your tokens will be lost forever.

Go on the admin page of your locker, connect with your wallet, and enter the address of
the token you want to remove in the **Lock / Withdraw** section, click on the **Withdraw**
button.

How to lock the tokens?
-----------------------

Go to the admin page of your locker, connect your wallet, choose a date and click
on the **Change** button. If you want to extend the lock time you can do it the same
way.

How do I see details about a locker?
------------------------------------

You can go on to the locker's admin page, connect your wallet and see the information
publicly available on the locker.

.. note::
  
  Admin actions such as locking, withdrawing and setting the dates are only available
  and displayed to the locker owner. Locker onwer is anyone who created the locker.
