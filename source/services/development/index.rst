Smart Contract Development
==========================

Kenshi offers custom token development and related services with high development
standards at a competitive cost!

Features
--------

Fully Commented
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We make sure all functions are commented, all complex processes are documented,
and all variable names are sensible! We keep the code readable, maintainable
and easily understandable.

Automatic Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We write automated unit tests for the smart contracts we develop. We deliver your
orders with 100% test coverage. Every function in your contract is tested to make
sure everything works as expected.

Beautifully Written
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We setup automated linting and formatting tools for your projects. We make sure
everything in the contract follows the same convention and the same style of code,
no inconsistencies are acceptable.

Security
~~~~~~~~

We follow the best practices. We setup automated vulnerability scanning for your
project and make sure there are no compiler warnings and no security issues before
delivering the project.

Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~

We're with you until the day you deploy your contract to the network of your choice.
If required, we can deploy the smart contract for you! We'll manage your token from
zero to the moon.

Free Audits
~~~~~~~~~~~

Your audit is on us! We give you a high quality service and generate a high quality
audit for your project.
