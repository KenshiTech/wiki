Investment Token
================

As an investment token, Kenshi provides passive income to its holders.
Simply holding Kenshi in your wallet is enough to receive this passive income.
The more tokens you hold the more you'll receive.

There are multiple sources for this income:

1. **Reflections:** A percentage of the purchase and sales taxes are automatically
   distributed back to the holders. By holding Kenshi tokens you're *investing* on
   the idea of Kenshi.
2. **Investments:** A percentage of each purchase goes to the treasury. Kenshi
   uses the tokens in treasury to develop new projects or invest on third party
   ones. A part of the profits earned from these projects are then distributed
   back to the holders.

You do not need to do anything specific to claim these benefits, they're active
for all holders and are deposited to your wallets automatically.
