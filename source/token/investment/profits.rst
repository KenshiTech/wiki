Profit Sharing
==============

Terminology
-----------

- **Capital:** the money or wealth needed to produce goods and services.
- **Revenue:** the total amount of money generated by the Kenshi projects.
- **Profit:** the amount of money that remains after accounting for all
  expenses and operational costs such as staff, maintenance and marketing.
- **Tax:** a compulsory financial charge placed on each transaction, collected
  by Kenshi in order to fund the Kenshi projects.

Holder's Shares
---------------

A percentage of every transaction, in form of tax, goes to the treasury.
The tokens accumulated in the treasury are used to provide capital to profit
yielding Kenshi projects. However, not all capital comes from the treasury.
Kenshi invests its own money on the projects as well. How much is taken from
the treasury and how much is invested by Kenshi depends on several factors,
such as:

- The complexity of the project
- The costs of running and maintaining the project
- The amount of tokens currently held in the treasury

Tokens, or money, taken out of treasury amounts to the shares of the holder's in
each specific project. The amount of capital provided by Kenshi, represents the
amount of shares Kenshi has in each project.

Distribution
------------

After gathering the revenue of each project and deducting the operational costs,
profits are distributed as follows:

- **Holders:** A percentage is reflected back to the holders based on how many
  tokens they hold.
- **Kenshi:** A percentage is taken by Kenshi as the company's share of profits.
- **Treasury:** A percentage is added to the treasury to fuel the future projects.

How much is distributed to each party (holders or Kenshi), depends on their share
of provided capital in each project. Kenshi does not charge a handling fee, 100%
of the profits that belong to the holders are reflected back to them.

Treasury
--------

Tokens accumulated in treasury will be used for implementation of new projects or
to improve, maintain and market current projects. Kenshi is the legal owner of the
tokens collected in the treasury through taxes. However, the profits gained from
the treasury are promised to be returned to the holders.

How are the profits shared?
---------------------------

Profits made with the Kenshi projects will be used to buy back Kenshi tokens.
These tokens are then all reflected to the holders.
