Reflections
===========

Reflection is the act of distributing a percentage of each transfer
to the holders, as a reward for holding the token. You can consider this
as a form of auto-staking. To receive reflections all you need to do is 
to hold some Kenshi tokens in your wallet.

.. note:: The number of reflections received by each holder is proportional
  to the number of tokens held in their wallet.
