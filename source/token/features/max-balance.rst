Adjustable Max Balances
=======================

There's a limit on how many tokens an account can hold. This limit increases
as the market cap of the token goes up.

Why is this good?
-----------------

At launch and in early days of the token's life, the price of the token is
very low. This can lead to some accounts having a huge amount of tokens in 
their wallets. There are a few reasons why Kenshi decided to put a cap on
that.

First of all, Kenshi wants to reach as many people as possible, instead of
having the tokens exclusively stored in the wallets of just a few. Kenshi
provides passive income to the holders, and we would like those with smaller
pockets benefit from it as well.

Another reason, is to prevent huge price fluctuations as a result of moving
a massive amount of tokens. Having a cap on how many tokens a wallet can hold
helps prevent this type of situation.
