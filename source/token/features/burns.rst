Burns
=====

Burning is the process of taking an amount of tokens out of circulation,
as if they've never existed. A burned token is gone and it never gets
traded ever again.

Why is this good?
-----------------

When an amount of tokens are taken out of circulation their pairing tokens
stay in place in the liquidity pool, this means there are now less tokens
being traded against the pairing token.

This in turn increases the value of each unit token, and guarantees the 
price of the token won't fall lower than a certain amount. Consider it a
form of reflection, but instead of increasing the amount of tokens in your
wallet, it will increase the value of each token held in your wallet.
