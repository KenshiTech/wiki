Tokenomics
==========

Token distribution
------------------

20% of the tokens are added to the initial liquidity pool. The remaining 80% are
added little by little to the DEX on each purchase from the DEX, check out the
`Liquidity Bootstrapping`_ page for more info about that.
There are no team or developer wallets or any other form of special allocation.

Total Supply
------------

The initial supply of the Kenshi token is 10 trillion tokens, which gets reduced by a
small amount on each transaction, until half of the entire supply is burned.

Tax
---

A regular 5% tax is distributed according to the following chart:

.. chart:: ../_static/charts/tokenomics.json

If the tax amount exceeds 5% (due to an early sale fine), then 1% of the transfer
is burned and the remaining tax is divided 1:1 between reflections and treasury.

Treasury
--------

Tokens held in treasury will be invested on Kenshi projects, returning part of
their profits to the holders.
