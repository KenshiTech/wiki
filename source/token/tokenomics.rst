Tokenomics
==========

Token distribution
------------------

20% of the tokens were added to the initial liquidity pool. The remaining 80% were
added little by little to the DEX on each purchase from the DEX, check out the
`Liquidity Bootstrapping`_ page for more info about that.
There were no team or developer wallets or any other form of special allocation.

Total Supply
------------

The total supply of the Kenshi token is 10 trillion tokens, with half the supply (5 trillion) burned.

Tax
---

A regular 5% tax is distributed according to the following chart:

.. chart:: ../_static/charts/tokenomics.json

If the tax amount exceeds 5% (due to an early sale fine), the remaining tax is distributed evenly between reflections and the treasury.

Treasury
--------

Tokens held in treasury will be invested on Kenshi projects, returning part of
their profits to the holders.
