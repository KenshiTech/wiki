How to Sell
===========

Since Kenshi is an investment token, holders promise to hold onto their
tokens for at least 30 days, otherwise, they will face a fine. This fine
is added to the `5% base tax`_ to make up the variable tax rates.
The fine is calculated logarithmically with the amount decreasing as
we move further away from the date of purchase.

How to sell during the first 30 days?
-------------------------------------

Due to our variable sell tax, you won't be able to sell your token on pancakeswap for at least three or four days.
If you still want to sell your tokens, use a DEX that allows slippage higher than 49% such as poocoin_

.. warning::
    Sale tax â‰  Slippage
    ex: setting 49% slippage when you currently have a 49% sale tax might not work
    sale tax isn't the only thing taken into consideration for slippage

On the first three to four days, you should try to set a slippage between 50% and 120%
