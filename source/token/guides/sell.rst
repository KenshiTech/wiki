How to Sell
===========

Since Kenshi is an investment token, holders will face a fine if they do not hold
onto their tokens for at least 28 days. This fine is added to the `5% base tax`_.
The fine is calculated logarithmically with the amount decreasing as we move
further away from the date of purchase. (See `variable tax`_).

How to sell during the first 30 days?
-------------------------------------

Due to our variable sell tax, you won't be able to sell your token on pancakeswap for at least three or four days.
If you still want to sell your tokens, use a DEX that allows slippage higher than 49% such as poocoin_

You can see what your sell tax is on the Kenshi `tools`_ page.

.. warning::
    Sale tax â‰  Slippage
    ex: setting 49% slippage when you currently have a 49% sale tax might not work
    sale tax isn't the only thing taken into consideration for slippage

On the first three to four days, you should try to set a slippage between 50% and 120%
