How to Sell
===========

Auto-staking is in place for all Kenshi holders, with a fine for those who
sell before 28 days are passed from the date of purchase. This fine is added to the 5%
base tax to make up for the variable tax rates. The fine is calculated logarithmically
with the amount decreasing as we move further away from the date of purchase.

.. warning::

  Kenshi is a utility token. The purpose of the token is to enable users to unlock
  the Kenshi services on the blockchain. The tax rules do not apply in cases where the
  token is used for the intended use case (eg. to access one of the various Kenshi
  services) and are in place to discourage any other use case.

How to sell during the first 30 days?
-------------------------------------

Due to Kenshi's variable sell tax, you won't be able to sell your token on PancakeSwap
for at least three or four days. If you still want to sell your tokens, use a DEX that
allows slippage higher than 49% such as poocoin_

.. warning::
    Sale tax â‰  Slippage
    ex: setting 49% slippage when you currently have a 49% sale tax might not work
    sale tax isn't the only thing taken into consideration for slippage

On the first three to four days, you should try to set a slippage between 50% and 120%
