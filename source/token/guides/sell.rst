How to Sell
===========

Auto-staking is in place for all Kenshi holders, with holders promising to hold their 
tokens for a minimum of 28 days. In case a holder decides to withdraw their tokens
before the 28 days, they will face an early withdrawal fine.

This fine is added to the `5% base tax`_ to make up for the variable tax rates.
The fine is calculated logarithmically with the amount decreasing as we move further
away from the date of purchase.

How to sell during the first 30 days?
-------------------------------------

Due to our variable sell tax, you won't be able to sell your token on PancakeSwap for at least three or four days.
If you still want to sell your tokens, use a DEX that allows slippage higher than 49% such as poocoin_

.. warning::
    Sale tax â‰  Slippage
    ex: setting 49% slippage when you currently have a 49% sale tax might not work
    sale tax isn't the only thing taken into consideration for slippage

On the first three to four days, you should try to set a slippage between 50% and 120%
