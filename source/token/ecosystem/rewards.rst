Ecosystem Rewards
=================

A percentage of every transaction, in form of tax, goes to the Kenshi treasury.
The tokens accumulated in the treasury are used in a variety of ways to promote and
grow the Kenshi ecosystem. This includes scale and growth of the Kenshi products,
as well as helping builders adopt the Kenshi tech.

Kenshi may occasionally deliver a small number of Kenshi tokens to the holders as a
token of appreciation for holding a floor price on the Kenshi ERC1363 token. It is
worth noting that the tokens accumulated in the Kenshi treasury are legally owned by
Kenshi and Kenshi have full control over operating them.

.. important::
  Kenshi doesn't have any obligations of any kind to distribute any profits in the form
  of rewards or any other way, or to report on how the tokens in the Kenshi treasury are
  used for the growth of the ecosystem. If any such attempts are made by Kenshi, they're
  done outside the legal obligations of Kenshi as a tech company.

Distribution
------------

The rewards are delivered by calling the ``deliver`` function of the Kenshi ERC1363
smart contract and are received automatically by each holder. The amount received by
each holder depends on the percentage of the tokens they hold at the time of the delivery.
