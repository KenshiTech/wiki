Kenshi Ecosystem
================

Kenshi ecosystem consists of all Kenshi tokens and products deployed to any of the
supported EVM blockchains. A percentage of each transaction is dedicated to the growth
of this ecosystem. Kenshi occasionally rewards the holders for keeping a floor price
for the token.

There are multiple sources for the said reward:

1. **Reflections:** A percentage of each transfer is automatically distributed back to the holders.
2. **Ecosystem Rewards:** Kenshi buybacks and delivers tokens to the holders.

You do not need to do anything specific to claim these rewards, they're active
for all holders and are deposited to your wallets automatically.
