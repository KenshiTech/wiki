Migration to v2
===============

The new Kenshi token built on the ERC1363 token standard is deployed to the
BSC mainnet on May 8th 2022. All holders of the previous ERC20 token are required
to migrate their tokens to the new version. The ERC20 token will be abandoned
and deprecated after the migration grace period is over. However, Kenshi won't
remove liquidity from the liquidity pools so all holder can continue to trade
the ERC20 token at their own concern and risk.

.. warning::
  Migrating is only possible on the Kenshi website. Please make sure you are on
  the correct website (e.g. the address in the browser address bar should exactly
  be `https://kenshi.io/migrate`). Do not connect your wallet to any other website
  for migrations, or for any other Kenshi related operation.

.. danger::
  Do not trust anyone who sends you a message regarding the migration process, even
  if they claim to be official Kenshi representatives. We never send you private messages
  and we never start conversations. Do not share your seed phrase or private keys with
  others.

To migrate your tokens, head over to `https://kenshi.io/migrate <https://kenshi.io/migrate>`_,
connect your wallet and click on the migrate button.

The migration starts on May 8th 2022, and ends on May 22nd 2022. Kenshi reserves
the rights to extend the end date of the migration process.

.. note::
  You won't be able to trade or transfer your new ERC1363 tokens before the migration
  process is over. Once the migration period is over the Kenshi team will provide liquidity
  for the new token. Subscribe to our official Twitter_ and Telegram_ channels for the
  announcements.

FAQ
---

Why a new token?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ERC1363_ standard defines the characteristics of a payable token. This token
standard makes it cheaper and easier to manage subscriptions and payments. This enables
us to accept payments more easily, and to be more efficient with our soon-to-be-released
VRF and Deep Index blockchain services.

What happens if I don't upgrade?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can choose to keep your current ERC20 tokens, and you'll be able to trade them after
the migration period is over. However, you won't be able to migrate your tokens to the 
new version anymore once the migration period is over. If you change your mind later, you'll
need to sell your ERC20 tokens and buy the new ERC1363 token.

.. warning::
  Once the migration process is over the price of the current ERC20 will
  drop significantly.

Is the migration process free?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Except the gas fee you need to pay for the migration, the process is taxless and free.
