Trading cryptocurrencies always comes with a lot of risks. Even if a
project is legit, it still does not mean you won't lose any money by
following in. Kenshi never promotes any other cryptocurrency and it
asks the users to always do their own research.

The identity of the founder of Kenshi is revealed publicly, the Kenshi team
is composed of highly experienced developers, our liquidity is locked, and
we're in the progress of getting registered as a company in Switzerland.
However, none of that means this is a risk-free investment.

Trading Kenshi tokens means you're accepting all the risks that come with
cryptocurrency. One day the market goes up, the next day it will crash.
The market is volatile, it's not predictable at all.

If you invest in Kenshi, it should be out of your own free will.
We ask you to not follow the hype. Instead check all details about Kenshi,
ask questions, contact us, do your research and use your own logic to decide
if it's worth it to invest or not. We respect your decision on this no matter
what you decide.

We wish you a happy and successful trading, best of luck.
